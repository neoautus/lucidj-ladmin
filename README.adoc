LucidJ Admin tool.

== Prerequisites for Building

* Java Development Kit 8 or later
* Ant (minimun Ant 1.8.0)

=== Building

TODO: Document the tool.

To build _all_ subprojects at once, just type `ant` on project root.

By default, Ant will download and cache all needed tools, then invoke the `build-all` target. The output of all builds will be located in `dist/` directory beneath every subproject. Karaf stage, will be built by default, so all bundles will be deployed into Karaf. If you change the stage to Felix (changing the stage target to Felix all bundles will

=== Useful Ant targets

For details on building the code, see `ant -p`.

These are the available targets:

* `ant build-all`: builds all available subprojects;
* `ant clean`: removes the `build` and `dist` directories;
* `ant zero`: same as `clean`, but also removes the `cache` directory with all downloaded tools;
* `ant configure`: rebuild the library and tools cache.

== Key Directories and Files

Important directories to be aware of:

* `cache` - stores the downloaded jars, custom tasks and other tools;
* `stage` - the local Apache Karaf installation built to test the subprojects.

The `configure.xml` file contains all the macros and targets used by the subprojects and it's worth looking. It can be used standalone on another projects.
